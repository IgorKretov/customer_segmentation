# Creating Customer Segments Through Unsupervised Learning
In this project, we are going to analyze a dataset containing wholesale information on various customers and their annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories. One goal is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so will empower the distributor with the ability to better structure their service to meet the needs of each customer such as i.e. delivery frequency.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Summary

This python code shows a descriptive way of how to cluster customer data using unsupervised machine learning tools to recommend or improve shipping frequency. To best follow through the report, it is helpful to install [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you'd like to only view the report, feel free to check out the `customer_segments.html` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `creating_customer_segments/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb```
```jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `customers.csv`. You can find more information on this dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) page.
