# Project 3: Unsupervised Learning
## Creating Customer Segments

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Summary

This python code shows a descriptive way of how to cluster customer data using unsupervised machine learning tools to recommend or improve shipping frequency. To best follow through the report, it is helpful to install [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you'd like to only view the report, feel free to check out the `customer_segments.html` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `creating_customer_segments/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb```
```jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `customers.csv`. You can find more information on this dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) page.
